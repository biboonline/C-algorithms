Trees are used to manipulate hierarchical data such as hierarchy of categories of a retailer or the directory
structure on your computer. They are also used in data analysis and machine learning both for hierarchical clustering and building complex predictive models, including some of the best-performing in practice
algorithms like Gradient Boosting over Decision Trees and Random Forests. In the later modules of this
course, we will introduce balanced binary search trees (BST) â€” a special kind of trees that allows to very
efciently store, manipulate and retrieve data. Balanced BSTs are thus used in databases for efcient storage
and actually in virtually any non-trivial programs, typically via built-in data structures of the programming
language at hand.
