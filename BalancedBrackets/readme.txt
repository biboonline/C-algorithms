 A text editor is implemented in such a way to check for brackets balance.

Input Format: Input contains one string which consists of big and small latin letters, digits, punctuation
marks and brackets from the set []{}().

Output Format: If the code in uses brackets correctly, output "Balanced" (without the quotes). Otherwise,
output "UnBalanced sequence" with the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there
are no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.
if the entered text is not brackets it outputs "the element number id unsupported"
